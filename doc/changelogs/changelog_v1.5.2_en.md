# v1.5.2

## Bugfixes
- **Object detection on all CPU cores**: This option is now disabled by default, as it caused unexpected reboots on some Kittyflaps. If it has been working reliably for you, you can simply re-enable it in the configuration panel.

---------

## Known Issues:
- **Display on iOS**: The display of the event overview on iOS devices is broken and the buttons to display the events do not work.
