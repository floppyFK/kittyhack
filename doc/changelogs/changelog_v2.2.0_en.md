# v2.2.0

## New Features
- **IP Camera Support**: In addition to the built-in camera, external IP cameras can now be used. This allows for more flexible positioning, e.g., for a better view of the prey in the cat's mouth.

## Improvements
- **Configuration Tab**: The settings are now more clearly organized in collapsible containers.
- **Update Process**: The update process via the web interface has been improved (this change will take effect from the next update after this version):
  - No more connection drops during updates.
  - Before updating, the flap function is locked to prevent interference.
