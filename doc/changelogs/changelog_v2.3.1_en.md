# v2.3.1

## New Features
- **Quick access to input and output control**: Configuration of input and output direction is now possible directly on the home page. Switching to the configuration tab is no longer necessary.

## Bugfixes
- **Watchdog for Wi-Fi connection**: If the Wi-Fi connection is lost, the system now automatically attempts to reconnect. After several unsuccessful attempts, the Kittyflap will automatically restart.
